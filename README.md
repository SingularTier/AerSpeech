A.E.R. Interface for Elite Dangerous

The average prices for commodities may not line up with the galactic average. This is because eddb.io is incorrect. 
If you have the time, and are willing, please consider updating the information in eddb.io! 
This will help change all those 'Unknowns' in to meaningful data. 

A.E.R. uses your system's TTS voice. A lot of streamers (and A.S.T.R.A.) use the IVONA Amy voice. I prefer the IVONA Ivy voice. Microsoft has a few low-quality voices available for download (such as Hazel and ZiraPro), but you have to fiddle to get them working.

How to Install:

Console version 
Extract to any folder and run 'AerSpeechConsole.exe'

Voice Attack Plugin 
Extract under the VoiceAttack\Apps folder.
The final location should be 'VoiceAttack\Apps\AER'. The AER subfolder is not optional.
